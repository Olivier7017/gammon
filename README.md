 1. Make PostProcess work if the calculation crash midrun
 2. The volume of the cell should also be an output 
 3. Add the thermalisation to the graph_nH and graph_E 
 4. Do not blindly assume Nd3MgNi14-2H and actually compute the mass for wt% in PostProcess
 5. Rename the project, as it is not a mock anymore
